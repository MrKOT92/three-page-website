    <h1>JavaScript History</h1>
    <h3>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262
        standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop
        JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8. </h3>
